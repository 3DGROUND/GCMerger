# What is GC Merger?

GC Merger – is a script to quickly insert a 3D model into your 3ds max scene directly from the Great Catalog site. 

You no longer have to download and unzip files, or deal with the chore of preparing a 3D model before merging it into your scene.

The script does all of this automatically. You press the Download button in the script and after a few seconds the 3D model appears in the scene…

GC Merger changes the usual approach to creating scenes, now it has become more convenient and easier, and most importantly, much faster.

# GC Merger Notes
* All 3D models on the site are specially adapted and prepared for easy and trouble-free insertion into the scene. GC-XXXXX-2019.max
* Minimum requirements for running GC Merger: 3ds max 2019 and Windows 10.
* You can download dozens of 3D models at once and continue to work in parallel, while 3ds max will not experience any load.
* By default all 3D models are downloaded to the “C:/temp/GC/” folder, change this path in the settings if necessary.
* All textures and assets have absolute paths and are referenced by default to the drive “C:/temp/GC/”. If necessary, transfer textures to your project using Resource Collector, Collect Asset and other scripts. Or use the built-in tools in 3ds max: Utilities  More  Bitmap/Photometric Paths  Edit Resources.
* If, for some reason, the Great Catalog Favorites page is not displayed and you see an error page, make sure that your computer does not have 3ds max related locks in Windows Firewall. For corporate networks, we recommend that you contact your Administrator.
* Downloaded models can take up GBs of disk space, please make sure you have enough space for the downloaded content.
