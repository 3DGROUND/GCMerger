# What is GC Merger?

GC Merger – is a script to quickly insert a 3D model into your 3ds max scene directly from the Great Catalog site. 

You no longer have to download and unzip files, or deal with the chore of preparing a 3D model before merging it into your scene.

The script does all of this automatically. You press the Download button in the script and after a few seconds the 3D model appears in the scene…

GC Merger changes the usual approach to creating scenes, now it has become more convenient and easier, and most importantly, much faster.
